                                  Introduction

The Iris dataset is a well known dataset containing information on three different types of Iris flowers: the Irish Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica (Schutten, Wiering, 2016, 2). Ronald .A. Fisher is the principal architecture of the dataset. The British statistician and biologist published the dataset for the first time in 1936, in his work: The Use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. This study is published in The Annals of Human Genetics, 1925-54, p.2 (179-188). Since then, various versions of the dataset have been published. Dr. E. Anderson is also an architecture of the iris dataset, for collecting the data, to investigate the flowers and set measurements used by Fisher (Fisher, The Annals of Human Genetics, p. (2) 179). In the pattern recognition literature, iris dataset is possibly the best known database to be found. Until now, Fisherâ€™s paper is the standard in the realm, and is cited recurrently (Scikit-learn, July 1988). Biologist, botanist and statistical scientists dispute on the veracity of the iris dataset, and in particular the possession or not of sepal by Iris flowers, (Kozak, Lotocka, 2014, p.579) is out of the scope of this project. The purpose of this project is to show how a dataset is manipulated and outputs results using a programming language as Python, as it is for this project.   As far as this programming and scripting 2020 project is concerned, we use the iris dataset version available at https:// git.github.com/csv and converted into a text file, that has been uploaded into our git account under the repository project2020-for-programming at Github (URL address: https://github.com/Samjean2020/project2020-for-programming.git).

                                  Dataset Characteristics

Dr E. Anderson found the iris flowers (Iris setosa and Iris versicolor), growing together in the same colony and measured them (Fisher, p.179, The Annals of Human Genetics). Dataset specifications comprise 150 as the number of instances, 50 in each of the three classes. The number of attributes is represented by 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class. Attribute information is as follows: sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length, petal width in cm and class including Iris-Setosa, Irish Versicolor and Iris Virginica (Scikit-learn, July 1988).
